My partners were Piotr Barycki and Aiden Barrett. We did most of the work
together as a group. For instance, each of the analysis and design diagrams were first
drawn on paper together, and then we each drew some of them on a computer.

Specific contributions:
- Activity Diagram
- Refined Class Diagram
- C++ program
- Doxygen documentation
