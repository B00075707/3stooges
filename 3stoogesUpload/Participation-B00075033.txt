My partners were Piotr Barycki and Conor Oâ€™Mathuna. Most of the work was completed as a group. The analysis and design documents were sketched out and planned on paper before individual implementation.

Specific contributions include:
- Class Diagrams
- State Class Diagrams
- Use Case Diagrams
- Fully Dressed Use Case Analysis

Performed Branch/Path analysis With Piotr.
